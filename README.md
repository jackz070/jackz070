# ü§∑ Bio

 I‚Äôve started studying to become a front-end developer in 2022. First I‚Äôve learnt HTML & CSS and then moved to JavaScript, React and TypeScript. I‚Äôm also paying a lot of attention to software testing, both in theory and practice. Big focus for me are the testing tools that allow me to test my code: Cypress, Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library. Right now I‚Äôm expanding all those skills by taking courses, making some open source contributions and building by own projects, a selection of which you can find above.

What I love about software development is feeling the impact it can make, how it may respond to the needs of others and improve their lives. So far, the projects I‚Äôm really happy about are my two portfolio websites (photography and web development) that I‚Äôve designed and built from scratch. They help me to reach out with my creations, which makes a world of difference to me!

How did I get here? Having got my Masters in International Relations / Strategic Studies & History and Culture of Jews in Poland I‚Äôve worked for 2,5 years in mental health area, at a self-help Clubhouse that follows the Clubhouse International¬†Standards of Quality (check it out, it‚Äôs an amazing approach to supporting people with mental health problems!). For me it was the time of learning to communicate better, listen to and understand needs of people more deeply and supporting them in finding their agency.

This experience led me to realise that what I really need in my life is pursuing the teenage dream that I gave up long time ago - becoming a software developer.
